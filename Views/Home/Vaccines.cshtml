            <h3>Vaccines</h3>
            <p>Modern vaccinology started around 1796 when Edward Jenner inoculated a boy, James Phipps, with the cowpox virus, after noting people who recovered had immunity to the related and more deadly smallpox.</p>
            <p>Louis Pasteur was one of the first to develop live attenuated cholera vaccines after using viruses weakened by time outside a host to inoculate chickens, causing immunity instead of a full infection. This was later extended to making an effective anthrax vaccine that could protect livestock like sheep and cows. In 1885, Pasteur developed an attenuated rabies vaccine that saved the life of a rabies bite victim, Joseph Meister.</p>
            <p>Vaccines generally work by introducing inactivated or dead viruses or bacteria or some of their components into the body to cause an immune response. This teaches the body to recognise the introduced pathogen and create a faster, more effective, directed response towards the pathogen next time an infection occurs.</p>
            <p>Many common and serious diseases like polio and smallpox have been eradicated in the past with vaccines, while common diseases like measles and tuberculosis (TB) can also be prevented in the modern day.</p>
